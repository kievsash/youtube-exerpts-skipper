## Youtube Exerpts skipper

When you watch Youtube with children and want to skip some moments which you find not appropriate for them. 
But sitting beside and forwarding video is not a good option  - you can do that now with this extention by just providing timespans you want to skip. 
It saves them for specific Youtube video id in the browser localstorage so you should not enter it again for another watching (of course until you clean the browser cache). 
Extention monitor video currentTime and skip timespans which you provided in the option window.
